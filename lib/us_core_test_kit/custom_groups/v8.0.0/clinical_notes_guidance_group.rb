      description %(
        The #{title} Sequence tests DiagnosticReport and DocumentReference
        resources associated with the provided patient. The resources returned
        will be checked for consistency against the [US Core Clinical Notes
        Guidance](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU4/clinical-notes-guidance.html)

        In this set of tests, Inferno serves as a FHIR client that attempts to
        access the different types of Clinical Notes specified in the guidance.
        The provided patient needs to have the following ten common clinical
        notes as DocumentReference resources:

        * Consultation Note (11488-4)
        * Discharge Summary (18842-5)
        * History & Physical Note (34117-2)
        * Procedures Note (28570-0)
        * Progress Note (11506-3)
        * Imaging Narrative (18748-4)
        * Laboratory Report Narrative (11502-2)
        * Pathology Report Narrative (11526-1)
        * Surgical Operation Note (11504-8)
        * Emergency Department Note (34111-5)

        The provided patient also needs to have the following three common
        diagnostic reports as DiagnosticReport resources:

        * Cardiology (LP29708-2)
        * Pathology (LP7839-6)
        * Radiology (LP29684-5)

        In order to enable consistent access to scanned narrative-only clinical
        reports, the US Core server shall expose these reports through both
        DiagnosticReport and DocumentReference by representing the same attachment
        url.
