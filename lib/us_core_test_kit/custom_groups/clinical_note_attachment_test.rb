    title 'DiagnosticReport and DocumentReference reference the same attachment'
    description %(
      All presentedForms urls referenced in DiagnosticReports shall have
      corresponding content attachment urls referenced in DocumentReference.

      There is no single best practice for representing a scanned, or
      narrative-only report due to the overlapping scope of the underlying
      resources and variability in system implementation. Reports may be
      represented by either a DocumentReference or a DiagnosticReport. To
      require Clients query both DocumentReference and DiagnosticReport to get
      all the information for a patient is potentially dangerous if a client
      doesnâ€™t understand or follow this requirement.

      To simplify the requirement, US Core IG requires servers implement the
      duplicate reference to allow a client to find a Pathology report, or
      other Diagnostic Reports, in either Resource.
