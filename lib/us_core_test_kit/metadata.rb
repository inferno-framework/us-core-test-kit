    title 'US Core Test Kit'
    description <<~DESCRIPTION
      The US Core Test Kit validates the conformance of a server implementation to a specific
      version of the [US Core IG](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core). Currently, Inferno can test
      against implementations of following versions of the US Core IG:
      [v3.1.1](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/),
      [v4.0.0](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU4/),
      [v5.0.1](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5.0.1/),
      [v6.1.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/),
      and
      [v7.0.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU7/).
      <!-- break -->

      This test kit is [open source](https://github.com/inferno-framework/us-core-test-kit#license)
      and freely available for use or adoption by the health IT community including EHR vendors,
      health app developers, and testing labs. It is built using the
      [Inferno Framework](https://inferno-framework.github.io/inferno-core/).
      The Inferno Framework is designed for reuse and aims to make it easier to build test kits
      for any FHIR-based data exchange.

      ## Status

      The US Core Test Kit is actively developed and regularly updated. Starting with STU3,
      each STU sequence is kept up-to-date with the latest version.

      The test kit currently tests the following requirements:

      - Support for Capability Statement
      - Support for all US Core Profiles
      - Searches required for each resource
      - Support for Must Support Elements
      - Profile Validation
      - Reference Validation
      - Clinical Notes Guidance
      - Missing Data Guidance

      See the test descriptions within the test kit for detail on the specific validations
      performed as part of testing these requirements.

      ## Repository

      The US Core Test Kit GitHub repository can be [found here](https://github.com/inferno-framework/us-core-test-kit).

      ## Providing Feedback and Reporting Issues

      We welcome feedback on the tests, including but not limited to the following areas:

       - Validation logic, such as potential bugs, lax checks, and unexpected failures.
       - Requirements coverage, such as requirements that have been missed, tests that necessitate
         features that the IG does not require, or other issues with the interpretation of the IGâ€™s requirements.
       - User experience, such as confusing or missing information in the test UI.

      Please report any issues with this set of tests in the
      [issues section](https://github.com/inferno-framework/us-core-test-kit/issues)
      of the repository.
