      title 'MedicationDispense resources returned during previous tests conform to the US Core MedicationDispense Profile'
      description %(
This test verifies resources returned from the first search conform to
the [US Core MedicationDispense Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-medicationdispense).
Systems must demonstrate at least one valid example in order to pass this test.

It verifies the presence of mandatory elements and that elements with
required bindings contain appropriate values. CodeableConcept element
bindings will fail if none of their codings have a code/system belonging
to the bound ValueSet. Quantity, Coding, and code element bindings will
fail if their code/system are not found in the valueset.
