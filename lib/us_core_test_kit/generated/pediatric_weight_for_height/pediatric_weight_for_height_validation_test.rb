    title 'Observation resources returned during previous tests conform to the US Core Pediatric Weight for Height Observation Profile'
    description %(
This test verifies resources returned from the first search conform to
the [US Core Pediatric Weight for Height Observation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/pediatric-weight-for-height).

It verifies the presence of mandatory elements and that elements with
required bindings contain appropriate values. CodeableConcept element
bindings will fail if none of their codings have a code/system belonging
to the bound ValueSet. Quantity, Coding, and code element bindings will
fail if their code/system are not found in the valueset.
