    title 'Server returns valid results for Observation search by patient + code'
    description %(
A server SHALL support searching by
patient + code on the Observation resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. US
Core requires that both forms are supported by US Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of US Core v3.1.1.
