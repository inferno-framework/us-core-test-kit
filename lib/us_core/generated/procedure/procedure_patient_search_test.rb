    title 'Server returns valid results for Procedure search by patient'
    description %(
A server SHALL support searching by
patient on the Procedure resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. US
Core requires that both forms are supported by US Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.
