_Test kit documentation is stored within the [./docs](/tree/main/docs) folder of
this repository and is automatically synchronized to the wiki with each update
to the `main` branch using a [GitHub
workflow](../actions/workflows/publish-docs-wiki.yml).  Do not change content
within the wiki directly as changes will be overwritten._
